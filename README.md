# bash Tools

Helper tools and how-tos for bash:

- [bash cheat-sheet](./bash.txt) - various solutions to bash scripting and command line runs

- custom [bash-git-prompt](./bash-git-prompt) themes - see https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt/ - for a super useful bash prompt that integrated git status and info into it. The most useful thing is that it shows you the current repo in the prompt so you never need to guess if you're committing into a wrong repo.
